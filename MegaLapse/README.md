GoPro Timelapses of 5 min, 20 minâ€¦ interval???

MegaLapse is the tool for making long timelapses with GoPro using higher intervals such as 2 mins to 45 mins.

#####It works with the HERO3 Black, HERO3+ Black, HERO3+ Silver, HERO3 Silver, HERO3 White and HERO2 cameras

I recommend to use this hack with a modified usb cable to fit in the housing, because the battery wont last too long.
