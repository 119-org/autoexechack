MegaLapse
============

YEAH!!!!!

Timelapses of 5 min, 20 minâ€¦ interval??? YES!!!

MegaLapse is the tool for making long timelapses using higher intervals such as 2 mins to 45 mins.


It works with the HERO3 black and the HERO3+ Black

If you want to save battery, choose the folder BlankScreenToSaveBattery, because it displays a blank screen.

I recommend to use this hack with a [Cam-Do USB Cable](http://cam-do.com/GoProUSBConnectors.html), because the battery wont last too long.
