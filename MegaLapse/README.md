MegaLapse
============

YEAH!!!!!

Timelapses of 5 min, 20 minâ€¦ interval??? YES!!!

MegaLapse WONT turn off and on the hero cam, but optionally, a folder called HWShutdown has a version of MegaLapse that turns off LCD; beeps; LEDs. Like turning off the hero cam.

Of you dont want to shutdown leds, lcd, beeps; A folder called NoHWSutdown has a version of MegaLapse with no HWShutdown.

It works with the HERO3 black and the HERO3+ Black



I recommend to use this hack with a [Cam-Do USB Cable](http://cam-do.com/GoProUSBConnectors.html), because the battery wont last too long.
