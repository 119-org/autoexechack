MegaLapse
============

YEAH!!!!!

Timelapses of 5 min, 20 minâ€¦ interval??? YES!!!

MegaLapse WONT turn off and on the hero cam, but optionally, a folder called HWShutdown has a version of MegaLapse that turns off LCD; beeps; LEDs.

I recommend to use this hack with a [Cam-Do USB Cable](http://cam-do.com/GoProUSBConnectors.html), because the battery wont last too long.
