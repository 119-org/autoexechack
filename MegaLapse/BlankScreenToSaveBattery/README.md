MegaLapse BlankScreenToSaveBattery
==================================

This hacks are the same as MegaLapse, but they save battery by displaying a blank screen.
It is recommendable to turn off leds by going to the settings, choose setup, then scroll to leds settings, choose off. Also turn off beeps by going to the settings, choose setup, scroll to sounds, choose off.

The folders are the intervals.

If you are not satisfied with an interval, choose the folder custom interval.
