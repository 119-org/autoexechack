SuperView Mode on HERO3 Black!
===============================

Dont have a HERO3 + black, but have a HERO3 Black and WANT TO HAVE SUPERVIEW??
Use this hack to SuperView your videos in your HERO3 Black.
When you turn the cam on, wait 2 seconds and press the rec button.

REMEMBER: Set Video to Default Mode.

By the way: three files: hor.bin, test.warp and ver.bin will be created in your SD, just delete them.
