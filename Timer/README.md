Timer
=====

Remember that feature in the HERO2 Camera, the Timer function? (a 10 seconds countdown and then take a pic)
It has dissapeared from the menu of the HERO3 Camera!!! :(
So, I made a hack that will bright the led you choose for 5 seconds, then a stop and then another 5 seconds the led you choose is bright, finally, it takes a picture.

You can choose the led position you want by going to the folder that has the name of that led, there you can download the hack.

REMEMBER: Set Photo to Default Mode, otherwise it wont work.
