#Secure Hack

###Update: DO NOT USE THIS HACK! MY CAMERA CANNOT READ HACKS FROM THE SD! UPDATES COMING SOON!!!

Hacks provided here work only if you keep the autoexec.ash file on the SD. The hacks are not permanent.
But... there is a way to hack the GoPro permanently, that can be used when you need to switch SDs, or for people who delete their content using the Delete all option from the gopro.
Using this way, the hack is inside the GoPro, not the SD.

###Howto:

So there is an autoexec.ash in the SD, and a autoexec.ash inside the DCIM folder in the SD. Lets call <b>"Real hack"</b> to the autoexec.ash that is inside the folder DCIM, and <b>"Move hack"</b> to the autoexec.ash that is in the root of the SD (like the traditional hacks).

So Move hack moves Real hack to the port A of the GoPro, so Real hack can be executed from the gopro directly. Then delete Move hack from the SD using the Delete all function from your gopro.

If you want to delete Real hack, that is inside the GoPro, then use DeleteRealHack. DeleteRealHack must be copied to the SD card (root) in order to delete the Real hack.

###Files:

* Real hack: whatever hack from this repo except from Move hack and DeleteRealHack
* [Move hack](movehack/autoexec.ash)
* [DeleteRealHack](deleterealhack/autoexec.ash)
