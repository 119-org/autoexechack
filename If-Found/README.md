#If found

So you are going to surf, snowboard, ski, bike... When you are practicing the sport the GoPro camera accidentally flies away from your mount and you cant find it or the waves get the camera to atlantis while you were surfing.

If someone finds the camera, that is his/her birthday present. 

But, if you downloaded and installed the hack that produces a IF_FOUND.txt file in the SD card the lucky person who found it, if s/he is a good person, he will contact you and send it to you.

Download and install the hack in your SD to have your information saved in the SD card.

###Use, Download and install.
Go to the file url, [here](https://github.com/KonradIT/autoexechack/blob/GoPro/If-Found/autoexec.ash)

Follow instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/KonradIT/ce55b04ab4ad10592ebf/#file-autoexechack-md) to download and install

Then open the file that is installed on the SD card with a text editor such as notepad (windows) or text edit (mac) or gedit (linux) and change the name (Konrad Iturbe) and the email adress (mail at chernowii dot com). NOTE: do not write @ and . for the email adress, use at, dot, slash (words, i mean)
Then save NOT save as.

###Do this too.

Apart from installing the hack on the SD, grab a piece of paper and write your name and email on it, and stick it to the camera's back, write other paper, fold it so it fits in the bottom of the case and camera.

Also, HeyIsItOn offers a free camera registration that is a must for gopro users, so go [here](http://www.heyisiton.com/gopro-camera-registration/) and register your camera.
