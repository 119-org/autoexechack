#Long Exposure Timelapse / Photos

Get those awesome long exposure timelapses using this hack, the exposure time is 2 seconds, download the hack (the hack is located [here](https://github.com/KonradIT/autoexechack/blob/GoPro/LongExpTimeLapse/autoexec.ash), to learn how to download it to your computer, checkout this [guide](https://gist.github.com/KonradIT/ce55b04ab4ad10592ebf/#file-autoexechack-md) ), open it in notepad++ or notepad or textedit or brackets or whatever and change P by the ISO, X by the exposure time and Y by the iris (exposure time also? it worked for me.)
Remember: P, X and Y are in hundredths, so 2 seconds are 200 hundredths.
