Use medium and narrow on 12MP, 7MP and 5MP on hero3 black/+black cameras

The recommendation is to use 12MP resolution, then you can have Medium and narrow fovs.
If you use 7MP Wide and try medium or narrow the result will be crap

Set the start up mode to photo, burst or timelapse and then take the picture
